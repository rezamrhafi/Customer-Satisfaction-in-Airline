This repository contains a data visualization project using Apache Airflow and Kibana. The goal of this project is to automate the data processing workflow and present it visually using Kibana. This repository includes Python files that explain the entire process, from setting up DAGs in Airflow, indexing data in Elasticsearch, to visualizing data in Kibana.

## Project Overview üìù

In this project, I use Apache Airflow to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and Kibana for visualizing the processed data. Some of the key steps covered in this project include:

1. **Airflow Setup**:
    - Configuring and running Airflow to manage the workflow.

2. **DAG Development**:
    - Building DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define the data workflow.

3. **Data Transformation**:
    - Performing necessary data transformations before visualization.

4. **Visualization with Kibana**:
    - Using Kibana to present data in a visually analyzable format.

## Problem Background:
The aviation industry has been significantly impacted by the global crisis in recent years. However, passenger traffic in 2022 reached about 76.9% of pre-crisis levels, and it is expected to fully recover by 2025. This recovery occurs amidst strong market growth and increasing competition in the aviation industry.

In an increasingly competitive business environment, customer satisfaction and loyalty become key factors in maintaining the sustainability of airline businesses. Satisfied customers are not only more likely to return to the same airline, but also provide positive recommendations that contribute to the company's image and profitability. Therefore, airlines must focus on improving the customer experience through better service, enhanced comfort, and operational efficiency.

By understanding customer needs and expectations, airlines can design more effective service strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. This will provide a competitive advantage in the ever-evolving industry, ensuring long-term growth amidst increasing market competition.
